## üîê Supported Versions

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.x.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 1.0   | :x:                |

## üìã Security Checklist for Developers

- [ ] Never commit secrets, API keys, or credentials
- [ ] Use environment variables for sensitive configuration
- [ ] Validate all user input
- [ ] Implement proper error handling (don't leak stack traces)
- [ ] Use prepared statements for database queries
- [ ] Implement rate limiting on sensitive endpoints
- [ ] Log security-relevant events
- [ ] Review dependencies for known vulnerabilities
- [ ] Use HTTPS in production
- [ ] Implement proper session management
- [ ] Follow principle of least privilege
- [ ] Regular security audits

## üö® Known Security Considerations

### Multi-Tenancy
- Always filter queries by `company_id`
- Verify user belongs to company before operations
- Prevent cross-tenant data leakage

### Third-Party Integrations
- Stripe: PCI DSS compliant payment processing
- Gusto: OAuth 2.0 secure authentication
- Railsr: Banking-grade security
- Google Cloud: Enterprise security standards
